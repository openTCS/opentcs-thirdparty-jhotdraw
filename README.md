# JHotDraw 7 with openTCS modifications

This project contains a fork of [JHotDraw 7](https://github.com/wrandelshofer/jhotdraw), which is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

This fork was originally created because integration of JHotDraw 7 with [openTCS](https://www.opentcs.org/) required library artifacts with some (minor) modifications and a project that produced official artifacts (which these modifications could have been contributed to) did not seem to be available.

This version of JHotDraw should be considered purely openTCS-specific.
It is not recommended to reuse it in other projects, as it is maintained only for the purposes of the openTCS project.
